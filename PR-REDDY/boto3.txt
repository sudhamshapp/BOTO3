In python we only interpret the code to be executable, but don't compile it

Immuatble - Not possible to change the value once it's assigned to a variable(string, tuples, numbers, booleans)
Mutable - vice-versa of Immuatble(lists, dictionaries and sets) - Memory address is static, that's the reason we can change the values

Declaring a variable and assigning a value to it happens at the same time i.e., a = 10(a is a variable and 10 is a value, whatever the data we give it takes it)

Traceback - in python terminology it can be called as an exception
